# PROGRAMMER: Taryn Sauer
# DATE CREATED: 3/1/19
# REVISED DATE:
# PURPOSE: Create a function classify_images that uses the classifier function
#          to create the classifier labels and then compares the classifier
#          labels to the pet image labels. This function inputs:
#            -The Image Folder as image_dir within classify_images and function
#             and as in_arg.dir for function call within main.
#            -The results dictionary as results_dic within classify_images
#             function and results for the functin call within main.
#            -The CNN model architecture as model wihtin classify_images function
#             and in_arg.arch for the function call within main.
#           This function uses the extend function to add items to the list
#           that's the 'value' of the results dictionary. You will be adding the
#           classifier label as the item at index 1 of the list and the comparison
#           of the pet and classifier labels as the item at index 2 of the list.
